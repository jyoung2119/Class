    The purpose of this program is to accept a user inserted string
and a user inserted search word. The program will then use the function
strstr() to find the first appearance of the search word in the original
string. After the search word is located, the remainder of the original
string beginning with the search word will be printed. The process will 
then be repeated in search for a second appearance of the search word
in the remainding string.
