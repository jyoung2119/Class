    This program originally started out as printing the numbers 1-100
and then their roman numeral equivalent. Due to a requirements change, 
the program now converts an integer value into roman numerals and vice 
versa. The output is dependent upon the input of the correct key (idf).
I used two switch cases to display the integer to roman numeral 
conversion. The first one prints the tens place and the second one prints
the other letters. I used nested if statements inside a for loop in order
to display the roman numeral to integer conversion.
